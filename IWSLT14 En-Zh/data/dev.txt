We get most of these blood vessels when we're actually still in the womb, And what that means is that as adults, blood vessels don't normally grow.	实际大多数我们的血管生成时候， 是我们还在子宫里时。 那意味着，作为成人， 血管通常不生长，
And in these situations, angiogenesis is out of balance.	在这些情形下，血管新生 不在平衡状态。

So the body's ability to balance angiogenesis, when it's working properly, prevents blood vessels from feeding cancers.	所以人体平衡血管生长的能力， 当它正常工作时， 能阻止血管饲养癌症。
So, if angiogenesis is a tipping point between a harmless cancer and a harmful one, then one major part of the angiogenesis revolution is a new approach to treating cancer by cutting off the blood supply.	如果血管增生 是一个转折点 使癌症从无害变到有害， 那么"血管新生的革命"的一个主要部分 就是用此作为一个新的途径， 通过切断血液供给来治疗癌症。
